# TheraDARplot
## A high-quality visualization of three genetic models plots using genome-wide association data
The Manhattan plot is a specialized form of scatterplot to display **genome-wide association studies (GWAS)**. 
Our results indicate that the combining methods of **three mode GWAS results** should increase the opportunity 
the significant and replicative results and reduce the substantial loss of power. Based on our study, 
we implemented a R package named ####**TheraDARPLOT** **(Dominance, Additive and Recessive combined Plot).** 
The R package DAR-PLOT facilitates the evaluation and visualization of the highest p-values among the three genetic models.
